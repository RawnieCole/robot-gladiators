#  **Robot Gladiators**

*Module 03 explores the power of JavaScript to build a super sleek browser-based computer game called Robot Gladiators that is to be entered in the Con Solo Game Jam, a competitive hackathon.  After the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the game is built, shift focus to improvements that will increase its complexity.*

> ###  Requirements:

Game Jam participants must create an engaging game that meets the following requirements:
*  The game must be created by a single Developer in 24-hours.
*  The game must run in a web browser.
*  The game must use the provided index.html file.
*  Only the <title> element of index.html may be changed.

> ###  Motivation:

After some reflection, the final decision is to build an action-packed robot combat simulator game called Robot Gladiators.  During the game, the player will coach their robot through a series of fights, gaining cash, attack power, and repairs along the way.  The robot who survives with the most cash will be remembered in the browser's storage system!
